## Installation from Source

Building and installing from the source is useful if you want to customize the code or if there is no pre-built binary available for your platform. It can also be a good learning experience if you are interested in how Suimon works.

1. **Install Dependencies**

   - The Suimon installation requires Go. If you don't already have Go installed, please visit [https://golang.org/dl](https://golang.org/dl) and [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install) for instructions on how to download and install Go on your system. Download the binary release that is suitable for your system and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Clone the Suimon repository**

   - Clone the Suimon repository by running the following command in your terminal:
     ```
     cd $HOME && \
     git clone https://github.com/bartosian/suimon.git && \
     cd suimon
     ```

3. **Install packages and dependencies**

   - Install packages and dependencies required by the Suimon tool by running the following command:
     ```
     go get -u ./...
     ```

4. **Build the Suimon package**

   - Build the Suimon package by running the following command:
     ```
     go build -o suimon cmd/main.go
     ```

5. **Move the built binary to the executable PATH**
   - Move the `suimon` binary to a directory that's listed in your executable PATH to make it easy to run the Suimon tool from anywhere in your terminal. You can find the list of directories in your executable PATH by running the following command in your terminal:
     ```
     echo $PATH
     ```
   - For example, if the output of the `echo $PATH` command includes `/usr/local/bin`, you can move the `suimon` binary to this directory by running the following command:
     ```
     mv suimon /usr/local/bin/
     ```
   - If you're not sure which directory to use, you can create a new directory in your home directory called `bin` by running the following command:
     ```
     mkdir $HOME/bin
     ```
     Then, add the `bin` directory to your executable PATH by adding the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g. `~/.bashrc` for Bash or `~/.zshrc` for Zsh):
     ```
     export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
     ```
     Finally, move the `suimon` binary to the `bin` directory by running the following command:
     ```
     mv suimon $HOME/bin/
     ```
6. **Create a Suimon config directory and put the config file there**

   - Create a directory for your Suimon config files by running the following command:

     ```
     mkdir $HOME/.suimon && \
     cp $HOME/suimon/main/static/templates/suimon-testnet.yaml $HOME/.suimon/suimon-testnet.yaml
     ```

     The 'suimon-testnet.yaml' file that you have just copied is a template file and must be customized with your specific environment data before running the Suimon tool.

   - For each network that you want to connect to, create a separate YAML file with the naming convention `suimon-<network>.yaml` and put it in the `.suimon` directory. For example, if you want to connect to the mainnet, you can create a file called `suimon-mainnet.yaml` and put it in the `.suimon` directory.

## Suimon Configuration Files

`Suimon` uses configuration files to manage settings and defaults for different environments and networks. The default configuration file for the Suimon tool is `suimon-testnet.yaml`, which is located in the `~/.suimon` directory. However, you can use multiple configuration files to manage settings for different networks and environments.

By properly configuring your Suimon configuration file, you can reduce the need for command-line interface (CLI) flags when running the tool. The configuration file can contain default values and settings that are automatically applied to the tool when it is executed. This can streamline your workflow and reduce the amount of time and effort required to run the tool.

You can also provide a different location for the configuration files by using the `SUIMON_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to the desired configuration directory path. This allows you to customize the location of the configuration files to your needs, such as if you want to store it in a specific directory or share it with others in a different location.

To manage settings for different networks and environments, create separate configuration files with the naming convention `suimon-<network>.yaml` and put them in the ~/.suimon directory. For example, if you want to connect to the mainnet, you can create a file called `suimon-mainnet.yaml` and put it in the `.suimon` directory.

### Example Suimon Config Directory

The names for these configuration files are up to the user. In this example, we've used the naming convention `suimon-<network>.yaml` to provide an example of how to name configuration files for different networks.

Here is an example file tree for the `~/.suimon` directory with separate configuration files for all sui networks:

```
~/.suimon
├── suimon-testnet.yaml
├── suimon-devnet.yaml
└── suimon-mainnet.yaml
```

### Suimon Configuration Fields

`Suimon` configuration files contain fields that allow you to customize the behavior of the tool to fit your specific use case. These files also enable you to add or remove monitored network entities and specify how they should be monitored. The suimon-testnet.yaml file, for instance, is a template configuration file that you can use as a starting point to create your own configuration file for testnet network. Before using Suimon, be sure to modify the configuration file with your own data and settings.

```yaml
# This section lists the public RPC endpoints that the client will use to monitor the network and calculate the health of the nodes and validators.
# Please make sure to provide at least one working endpoint.
public-rpc:
  - https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443
  - https://rpc-ws-testnet-w3.suiprovider.xyz:443
  - https://sui-api.rpc.com:443

# if you wish to monitor the nodes, update this section with the nodes information
full-nodes:
  - json-rpc-address: 0.0.0.0:9000
    metrics-address: 0.0.0.0:9184
  - json-rpc-address: https://sui-rpc.testnet.com
    metrics-address: https://sui-rpc.testnet.com/metrics

# if you wish to monitor the validators, update this section with the validators information
validators:
  - metrics-address: 0.0.0.0:9184/metrics
  - metrics-address: https://sui-validator.testnet.com:9184/metrics
  - metrics-address: https://sui-validator.testnet.com:9184/metrics

# provider and country information in tables is requested from https://ipinfo.io/ public API. To use it, you need to obtain an access token on the website,
# which is free and gives you 50k requests per month, which is sufficient for individual usage.
ip-lookup:
  access-token: 55f30ce0213aa7 # temporary access token with requests limit
```

1. **public-rpc**

The `public-rpc` section lists the public RPC endpoints that the client will use to monitor the network and calculate the health of the nodes and validators. Therefore, it is essential to provide accurate and up-to-date endpoint information in this section.
This field is required to request system metrics and to calculate the health of nodes and validators. The other fields are optional and can be updated if needed.

```yaml
public-rpc:
  - https://wave3-rpc.testnet.sui.io:443"
  - https://rpc-ws-testnet-w3.suiprovider.xyz:443
  - https://sui-api.rpc.com:443
```

These endpoints are managed by the SUI team, which you can use alongside your own to monitor the relevant networks.

| Network | RPC Endpoint                      |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| Devnet  | `https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io`  |
| Testnet | `https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io` |
| Mainnet | `https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io` |

3. **full-nodes**

The `full-nodes` section lists the full nodes for monitoring in the SUI network. The user can update this section with information for any number of nodes, following the example format provided. It is important to note that the RPC address is required to be provided for each node, while the metrics address is optional.

```yaml
full-nodes:
  - json-rpc-address: 0.0.0.0:9000
    metrics-address: 0.0.0.0:9184
  - json-rpc-address: https://sui-rpc.testnet.com
    metrics-address: https://sui-rpc.testnet.com/metrics
```

4. **validators**

The `validators` section lists the validators to monitor. The user can update this section with information for any number of validators, following the example format provided. It is important to note that only the metrics endpoint is required to be provided for each validator.

```yaml
validators:
  - metrics-address: 0.0.0.0:9184/metrics
  - metrics-address: https://sui-validator.testnet.com:9184/metrics
  - metrics-address: https://sui-validator.mainnet.com:9184/metrics
```

5. **ip-lookup**

The `ip-lookup` section provides information on how to use the `ipinfo.io` public API to get provider and country information in tables. The user needs to obtain an access token on the website to use this feature. The current access token provided is temporary with a limited number of requests per month.

```yaml
ip-lookup:
  access-token: 55f30ce0213aa7 # temporary access token with requests limit
```

## Suimon Commands

The Suimon tool provides several commands that offer capabilities to monitor the SUI network and its entities. Here is an overview of the main commands:

- `suimon help`: provides detailed information about how to use any of the available Suimon commands, including a brief description of what each command does and the syntax for using it. This command can be used to quickly learn how to use any of the other Suimon commands, making it an essential tool for getting started with Suimon monitoring.
